When exploring the system, is useful to have a single entry point that will allow users to search for different component of the system.
Spotter provides such entry point and is usually available by pressing <meta+enter>.

Pulse is a remake of Spotter, a front-end to show the result of different processors that provide results. Those processors can be configured in different ways and will provide different access options.

The idea is to divide the old Spotter in 3 tabs: 
•  Environment for classes, methods, packages
•  Windows for every open window in the image
•  Tools for menu items

Some known processors and options are:

Classes processor:
•	Type #classes in the search bar
•	Press <meta+b>


Implementors processor:
•	Type #implementors in the search bar
•	Press <meta+m>
