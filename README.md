# Pulse

> ðŸ’¡ Most of the information is available in the **help icon** when you open the tool.

## Overview

When exploring the system, it's useful to have a single entry point to search across different components. **Pulse** provides such an entry point and is usually available by pressing `<Meta+Enter>`.

Pulse is a **remake of Spotter**, a front-end tool for displaying results from various processors. These processors can be configured in different ways to provide flexible access options.

## Interface Tabs

Pulse splits the traditional Spotter interface into three distinct tabs:

- **Environment** â€” for classes, methods, and packages  
- **Windows** â€” for every open window in the image  
- **Tools** â€” for menu items  

---

## Search Behavior

- Pulse fetches the first 25 results, but loads the first 3 results immediately via events to improve responsiveness.
- You can request the full results by using the down arrow button or `<Meta + â†“>`.
- A background service runs every **50 milliseconds** to manage the search behavior asynchronously.
  - Logic handled in: `StPulse >> processSearch`
- When typing, the service triggers the search.
- When changing tabs, a separate search is executed outside the service.
- A spinner gives visual feedback during searches.

---

## History Entries

Any class, method, or package you open (from the Environment tab) is stored as a `HistoryEntry`:

- **Classes/Methods** â†’ contents serialized as a string  
- **Packages** â†’ stores the package name and re-queries on retrieval  

This avoids hard references and all entries are stored in a **circular memory logger**, which auto-cleans any `nil` or invalid entries.

---

## Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard shortcuts are available at both the window level and individual presenters for full mouse-free navigation.

Multiple shortcuts allow you to open Pulse directly into a specific tab, enhancing speed and usability.

---

## UI Features

- Designed to work with **Pharo's new memory of window size**.
- Special handling was implemented for **modal resizing**, requiring Spec-level customization.
- New Spec styles were added to lists (e.g., `rowHeight`) to support this tool.

## Processors & Shortcuts

| Processor        | Search Keyword    | Shortcut      |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Classes**      | `#classes`        | `<Meta+B>`    |
| **Implementors** | `#implementors`   | `<Meta+M>`    |
| **Packages**     | `#packages`       | `<Meta+P>`    |
